                </header>
                <section>
                    <p>My professional journey has been diverse and enriching, spanning roles in leading technology companies, innovative startups, and prestigious research institutions. Each experience has contributed significantly to my growth as a software engineer and researcher, allowing me to tackle complex challenges and deliver impactful solutions.</p>
                    
                    <h2>Current Role</h2>
                    <p>Currently, I am excited to be a <strong>Software Development Engineer at Amazon</strong>, a role I commenced in May 2025 in Seattle, Washington. I look forward to contributing to Amazon's innovative projects and leveraging my skills in a dynamic and challenging environment.</p>
                    
                    <h2>Previous Experiences</h2>
                    <p>Prior to Amazon, from May 2024 to May 2025, I served as a <strong>Software Developer at 11Sight</strong> in the San Francisco Bay Area. In this full-time role, I was deeply involved in building multimodal AI agents, capable of voice and text interactions, designed to manage reservations for car dealerships. This initiative grew from a nascent project involving a handful of dealerships to become a major pivot point for the startup, expanding its reach to over 40 dealerships. My contributions included significantly improving the tech stack, working extensively with Ruby on Rails, TypeScript, PostgreSQL, and Google Cloud Services to enhance functionality and scalability.</p>
                    
                    <p>Between April 2024 and January 2025, I embraced the challenge of co-founding <strong>shuffl mobility Inc.</strong>, where I served as the <strong>Chief Technology Officer (CTO)</strong> in Berkeley, California. From the ground up, I led the creation of a mobile application for both Android and iOS platforms, dedicated to offering efficient ride-hailing solutions for groups of two to five people. My responsibilities encompassed the entire lifecycle, from conceptualization and system architecture design to the development and release of a full Minimum Viable Product (MVP). This application was successfully launched on the AppStore and utilized by students at UC Berkeley.</p>
                    
                    <p>My passion for research led me to the <strong>Wheeler Water Institute at Berkeley Center for Law</strong>, where I worked as a <strong>Quantitative Researcher</strong> from August 2023 to August 2024 in Berkeley, California. This apprenticeship involved conducting a comprehensive quantitative evaluation of financing adequacy in Groundwater Sustainability Plans (GSPs) following the 2014 Sustainable Groundwater Management Act (SGMA). I applied natural language processing techniques for text classification across all GSPs submitted to the Department of Water Resources (DWR) and utilized Large Language Model (LLM) outputs to derive insightful recommendations for proactive financing strategies. This work, for which I received a research stipend, aimed to contribute to the broader goal of achieving groundwater sustainability by 2040.</p>
                    
                    <p>During the summer of 2023 (May to August), I interned as a <strong>Quantitative Researcher at Prime Trading, LLC</strong> in Chicago, Illinois. In this role, I analyzed historical data from the Chicago Board of Exchange to predict future market trends. My responsibilities included processing and cleaning raw trade logs to enhance data consistency for robust analysis. I applied various quantitative models, such as ARIMA for time series analysis, Random Forests, and cointegration tests, to derive actionable trading insights. Collaborating with the software team, I contributed to automating data extraction and preprocessing tasks, which reduced manual workload by approximately 40%. My work on refining trading strategies through model-derived insights contributed to a 5% increase in profitability and enhanced my technical proficiency in integrating complex models into real-time trading systems.</p>
                    
                    <p>From January 2022 to January 2023, I was engaged as a <strong>Deep Learning Researcher at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory</strong>, based in Berkeley, California. This apprenticeship focused on an anomaly detection project within the realm of Modern Physics. As part of a research group led by Professor Benjamin Nachman, I contributed to pioneering cross-cutting research aimed at understanding new particle collisions using machine learning. My work involved exploring applications of generative modeling to fundamental physics, conducting method comparisons, and addressing the practical challenges of training and deploying these advanced models.</p>
                    
                    <p>My early research experience includes a significant internship as a <strong>Software System Engineering Intern at Nokia Bell Labs</strong> in New Jersey. During this period, I delved into research on blockchain technologies. My capstone project involved creating a decentralized Web3 marketplace application, which I successfully presented to the Bell Labs team. This marketplace ingeniously encrypted user bids utilizing Elliptical Curve Cryptography. To achieve this, I developed a Solidity library and deployed it on a test-chain, demonstrating my ability to innovate with emerging technologies and deliver functional, secure applications.</p>
