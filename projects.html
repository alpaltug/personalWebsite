                <section>
                    <p>Throughout my career and academic pursuits, I have had the opportunity to work on a variety of exciting and challenging projects. These endeavors have allowed me to apply my technical skills, explore new technologies, and contribute to meaningful outcomes. Below are some of the key projects that highlight my capabilities and passion for innovation.</p>

                    <h2>Decentralized Web3 Marketplace Application</h2>
                    <p>One of the significant projects I led was the development of a <strong>Decentralized Web3 Marketplace Application</strong> during my internship at Nokia Bell Labs. This project was a deep dive into blockchain technologies and their practical applications. The core challenge was to create a secure and transparent platform for transactions. I designed and implemented a marketplace where user bids were encrypted using Elliptical Curve Cryptography, ensuring the confidentiality and integrity of the bidding process. A key component of this project was the development of a custom Solidity library, which I then deployed on a test-chain. This project not only showcased my ability to work with cutting-edge Web3 technologies but also my skills in cryptographic security and smart contract development. Presenting this application to the Bell Labs team was a rewarding experience, demonstrating the potential of decentralized systems.</p>

                    <h2>Mobile Ride-Hailing Application (shuffl mobility Inc.)</h2>
                    <p>As the co-founder and CTO of <strong>shuffl mobility Inc.</strong>, I spearheaded the creation of a <strong>Mobile Ride-Hailing Application</strong> tailored for groups. This project was a comprehensive undertaking, starting from the initial idea and progressing through system architecture design, development, and finally, the launch of a Minimum Viable Product (MVP). The application, available on both Android and iOS platforms, was designed to provide a seamless and efficient ride-sharing solution for students at UC Berkeley. This involved complex backend development to manage user accounts, ride requests, and matching algorithms, as well as intuitive frontend design for a user-friendly experience. Successfully bringing this product to market was a testament to my leadership, technical execution, and ability to manage the full lifecycle of a software product.</p>

                    <h2>Multimodal AI Agents for Car Dealerships (11Sight)</h2>
                    <p>At 11Sight, I was a key developer for <strong>Multimodal AI Agents for Car Dealerships</strong>. This project focused on leveraging Artificial Intelligence to enhance customer interactions and streamline operations for automotive businesses. I worked on building sophisticated AI agents capable of understanding and responding to both voice and text-based queries. These agents were designed to handle tasks such as scheduling appointments, answering frequently asked questions, and providing information about vehicles. The technology stack included Ruby on Rails, TypeScript, PostgreSQL, and Google Cloud Services. My contributions were pivotal in scaling this solution from a small pilot with a few dealerships to a core offering for over 40 dealerships, demonstrating my ability to build and scale AI-driven enterprise solutions.</p>

                    <h2>Anomaly Detection Project in Modern Physics (Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory)</h2>
                    <p>My research work has also involved significant project contributions. At Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, I was part of an <strong>Anomaly Detection Project in Modern Physics</strong>. Working with Professor Benjamin Nachman, this project aimed to use deep learning techniques to identify unusual patterns in particle collision data. My role involved exploring various generative models, comparing their effectiveness, and addressing the practical challenges of training and implementing these models in a high-stakes research environment. This project allowed me to apply my machine learning expertise to fundamental scientific research, contributing to the understanding of complex physical phenomena.</p>

                    <h2>Quantitative Evaluation of Groundwater Sustainability Plans (Wheeler Water Institute)</h2>
                    <p>Furthermore, at the Wheeler Water Institute, I undertook a <strong>Quantitative Evaluation of Groundwater Sustainability Plans</strong>. This project involved analyzing extensive textual data from Groundwater Sustainability Plans (GSPs) submitted to California's Department of Water Resources. I applied Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and utilized outputs from Large Language Models (LLMs) to assess the adequacy of financing strategies outlined in these plans. The goal was to provide actionable recommendations to the DWR for promoting proactive and effective financing for groundwater sustainability. This project highlighted my skills in data analysis, NLP, and my ability to translate complex data into policy-relevant insights.</p>

                    <p>These projects represent a cross-section of my work, demonstrating my versatility across different domains, from web and mobile development to AI/ML research and blockchain technology. Each project has been a valuable learning experience, reinforcing my commitment to using technology to solve real-world problems and drive innovation.</p>
